            Sid Sriram was born in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, to a Tamil family.
             He moved with his parents to California at the age of one, growing up in Fremont. 
             His musical skills were nurtured by his mother, Latha Sriram, a Carnatic music teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area.
              He started learning Carnatic music since he was 3 years old.

         He simultaneously started picking up R&B.
          After graduating from Mission San Jose High School in 2008, he joined the Berklee College of Music and graduated in music production and engineering.
          Since his graduation, he has been regularly visiting India and performing Carnatic concerts, including as a part of the December Music season - Marghazhi Utsavam. 

         Since then, he moved back to India and currently resides in the Mylapore area in Chennai.</li>
